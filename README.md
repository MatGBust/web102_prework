## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The only challenges that I encountered was remembering that the javascript code would not always return explicit errors.  So when attempting to append an element, it wouldn't work because that line of code was not being run, because of previous errors.  However, I overcame this issue by having debug console.log lines to know what is being run.
